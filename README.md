# FarmBnB

This repository is configured for Vercel deployment of the frontend app located in `frontend/`.

## Deploying to Vercel

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended - using root vercel.json)
1. **Import Repository** in Vercel Dashboard
2. **Root Directory**: Leave as `.` (root) - the `vercel.json` at root will handle frontend build
3. Vercel will automatically:
   - Run `cd frontend && npm install && npm run build`
   - Output to `frontend/dist`
4. Add environment variables (see below)

### Option 2: Manual Root Directory
If you want to set Root Directory manually:
1. **Import Repository** in Vercel Dashboard  
2. **Root Directory**: Type `frontend` manually (even if not visible in dropdown)
3. **Framework Preset**: Vite (auto-detected)
4. **Build Command**: Auto-detected (`npm run build`)
5. **Output Directory**: Auto-detected (`dist`)

### Environment Variables (set in Vercel Project Settings):
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` → Your API base URL (e.g., `https://api.example.com`)
- `VITE_UPI_ID` → UPI ID to display on the Payment page
- `VITE_UPI_QR_CODE_URL` → Public URL to the QR code image

**Note**: The root `vercel.json` configures the build to use the `frontend` directory. The `frontend/vercel.json` handles SPA routing.

## Local Development

```bash
cd frontend
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- Backend (`routes/`, `server.js`) is not deployed on Vercel. Use an external host for the Node API and point `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to it.
- Static frontend is built and served by Vercel using `@vercel/static-build` as configured in `vercel.json`.
